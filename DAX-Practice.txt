This will be my go-to Practice Document for DAX .
SUM(Table[ColName])  - SUM provides summation of all values in column.
SUMX(<Table> , <Expression>) - SUMX Provides row by row evaluation of expressions.
Count() - Count(Table[ColName]) is to count non-blank numeric entries in a table.
Counta() - Counta(Table[ColName]) is to count all types of non-blank entries irrespective of data types be it numeric, text , string eic.
Countx() - CountX(<Table_Name>, <Expression>) - evaluates an expression row by row , it is just like counta() for row by row expressions.
DistinctCount() - DISTINCTCOUNT(Table[Column]) - Returns a unique count of values in a column.(Duplicates are counted only once).
Range() - Range(Table[ColName]) - Gives out a difference between maximum and minimum value in a column, therefore the range of values.
Rangex() - Rangex(<Table>, <Expression>) - provide a way to evaluate an expression row by row and the finds the range in caluculated values.
Average(Table[ColName]) - Returns the arithmetic average of the column.
Averagex(<Table> , <Expression>) - Iterates over the table , evaluates an expression row by row and returns the average.
MAX(Table[ColumnName]) - Returns the Maximum Value in a Column.
Min(Table[Column]) - Returns the Minimum Value in a Column. 
Calculate() - Calculate(<Expression>, <Filter1> ...) - way to modify filter context while evaluating expressions. It Applies Filter Context before evaluating expressions.
Filter() - FILTER(<Table>, <Expression>) - way to fetch out a virtual table from the orignal table on the basis of applied expression. however since it makes a virtual table and therefore not recommended to use in case of large datasets because it can slows down the performance.
