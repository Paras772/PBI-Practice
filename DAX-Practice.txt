This will be my go-to Practice Document for DAX .
SUM(Table[ColName])  - SUM provides summation of all values in column.
SUMX(<Table> , <Expression>) - SUMX Provides row by row evaluation of expressions.
Count() - Count(Column_Name) is to count non-blank numeric entries in a table.
Counta() - Counta(Column_Name) is to count all types of non-blank entries irrespective of data types be it numeric, text , string eic.
Countx() - CountX(<Table_Name>, <Expression>) - evaluates an expression row by row , it is just like counta() for row by row expressions.
